💻 Polynomial Addition in C — Line-by-Line Explanation
#include <stdio.h>


➡️ Includes the Standard I/O library so we can use printf() and scanf().

struct Term{


➡️ Starts the definition of a struct named Term (a custom data type).

    int coeff,exp;


➡️ Inside each Term, we store:

coeff → the coefficient of the term (like 5 in 5x³)

exp → the exponent of the term (like 3 in 5x³)

};


➡️ Ends the structure definition.

int main(){


➡️ Entry point of the program. Execution starts here.

    int n1,n2,nres;


➡️ Declares three integers:

n1 → number of terms in polynomial 1

n2 → number of terms in polynomial 2

nres → number of terms in the result polynomial (will be set later)

    printf("Enter number of terms in poly 1 : ");


➡️ Prints a message asking the user for the number of terms in the first polynomial.

    scanf("%d",&n1);


➡️ Reads the integer entered by the user and stores it in n1.

    printf("Enter number of terms in poly 2 : ");


➡️ Asks the user for the number of terms in the second polynomial.

    scanf("%d",&n2);


➡️ Reads the integer entered by the user and stores it in n2.

    struct Term p1[n1],p2[n2],res[40];


➡️ Declares three arrays of struct Term:

p1[n1] → stores all terms of polynomial 1

p2[n2] → stores all terms of polynomial 2

res[40] → stores terms of the resulting polynomial (max allowed 40 terms)

⚠️ Note: This uses variable-length arrays (VLA). res is fixed-size 40.

    printf("Enter terms of Poly1 : \n");


➡️ Prompts user to enter each term of the first polynomial.

    for(int i = 0 ; i < n1 ; i++){


➡️ Starts a loop to input all n1 terms of polynomial 1.

i starts at 0 and goes up to n1 - 1.

        scanf("%d %d",&p1[i].coeff,&p1[i].exp);


➡️ For each term:

Reads two integers: coefficient and exponent.

Stores them in p1[i].coeff and p1[i].exp.

    }


➡️ Ends the loop for taking input of polynomial 1.

    printf("Enter terms of Poly 2 : \n");


➡️ Prompts user to enter each term of the second polynomial.

    for(int j = 0 ; j < n2 ; j++){


➡️ Starts a loop to input all n2 terms of polynomial 2.

j goes from 0 to n2 - 1.

        scanf("%d %d",&p2[j].coeff,&p2[j].exp);


➡️ Reads coefficient and exponent for each term of polynomial 2 and stores in p2[j].

    }


➡️ Ends the loop for taking input of polynomial 2.

    int i = 0 , j = 0 , k = 0;


➡️ Initializes three index variables:

i → current position in p1

j → current position in p2

k → current position in res (result array)

👉 These three will be used in the merge-like logic (similar to merging two sorted arrays).

    while (i<n1 && j<n2){


➡️ Starts a loop that runs as long as both:

i is a valid index in p1 (i < n1)

j is a valid index in p2 (j < n2)

💡 This means: process terms while both polynomials still have unprocessed terms.

        if(p1[i].exp == p2[j].exp){


➡️ If the current terms in both polynomials have the same exponent,
it means these represent like terms, e.g., 3x² and 5x².

            res[k].coeff = p1[i].coeff + p2[j].coeff;


➡️ Adds coefficients of those like terms and stores the result in res[k].coeff.

            res[k].exp = p1[i].exp;


➡️ Sets the exponent of the resulting term to that shared exponent (p1[i].exp or p2[j].exp, both are same).

            i++; j++; k++;


➡️ Moves ahead:

i++ → go to next term in p1

j++ → go to next term in p2

k++ → move to next empty slot in res

        }


➡️ Ends the if block for equal exponents.

        else if (p1[i].exp > p2[j].exp){


➡️ If exponents are not equal, and the exponent in p1 is greater than that in p2.

⚠️ This assumes both inputs are given in descending order of exponents.
So higher exponent term should appear earlier in polynomial expression.

If p1[i].exp > p2[j].exp, it means:

The term in p1 has higher degree and should appear earlier in the sum.

            res[k] = p1[i];


➡️ Copies the entire term p1[i] (both coeff and exp) into res[k].

            i++; k++;


➡️ Moves:

to the next term in p1

to the next position in the result.

        }


➡️ Ends the else if block.

        else{


➡️ This else runs when:

p1[i].exp < p2[j].exp

So the term in polynomial 2 has a higher exponent.

            res[k] = p2[j];


➡️ Copies the term from p2[j] to res[k].

            j++; k++;


➡️ Moves:

to the next term in p2

to the next result position.

        }


➡️ Ends the else block.

    }


➡️ Ends the while (i<n1 && j<n2) loop.

At this point:

One of the polynomials has been fully processed.

The other may still have some remaining terms.

    while(i<n1) res[k++] = p1[i++];


➡️ If there are still terms left in p1 (i.e., i < n1):

Copy remaining terms directly into result.

res[k++] = p1[i++] means:

Copy p1[i] into res[k]

Then increment both i and k.

    while(j<n2) res[k++] = p2[j++];


➡️ Similarly, if there are terms left in p2:

Copy them into res.

Again, both j and k are incremented after each copy.

💡 These two while loops ensure all leftover terms (from whichever polynomial is longer) are added to the result.

    nres = k;


➡️ After merging, k holds total number of terms put in res.
So nres is set to k to remember result size.

    printf("\n1st poly: ");


➡️ Prints label before showing polynomial 1.

    for(int i = 0 ; i < n1 ; i++){


➡️ Loop to print all terms of polynomial 1.

        printf("%dx^%d",p1[i].coeff,p1[i].exp);


➡️ Prints each term in the format coefficient x^exponent
Example: 5x^3

        if(i!=n1-1) printf(" + ");


➡️ Prints " + " between terms, but not after the last term.

    }


➡️ Ends loop for printing polynomial 1.

    printf("\n2nd poly: ");


➡️ Prints label before showing polynomial 2.

    for(int j = 0 ; j < n2 ; j++){


➡️ Loop to print all terms of polynomial 2.

        printf("%dx^%d",p2[j].coeff,p2[j].exp);


➡️ Prints each term of polynomial 2 in the same ax^b format.

        if(j!=n2-1) printf(" + ");


➡️ Again, prints " + " only between terms.

    }


➡️ Ends loop for printing polynomial 2.

    printf("\nResult: ");


➡️ Prints label before showing the result polynomial.

    for(int k = 0 ; k < nres ; k++){


➡️ Loop to print all terms of the result polynomial.

        printf("%dx^%d",res[k].coeff,res[k].exp);


➡️ Prints each result term in ax^b format.

        if(k!=nres-1) printf(" + ");


➡️ Prints " + " between result terms, but not after the last.

    }


➡️ Ends loop for printing the result.

    printf("\n");


➡️ Prints a newline for clean output after everything.

}


➡️ Ends the main() function and the program.
